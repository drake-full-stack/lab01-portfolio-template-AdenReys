The most challenging part was the styling, one wrong move could break the layout. making an img too big or your styling inconsistent could lead to a lot of frustration. 

The importance of using appropriate tags to convey meaning and structure.i spend some time fiddling around. 

In the future, I plan to expand this portfolio by adding some projects i've completed and improving the designs.</p>

*This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!*
